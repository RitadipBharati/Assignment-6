#
## Numerically integrate the following using Midpoint, Trapezoidal and Simpson techniques for N = 8, 16 and 24 and compare the result (in tabular format) with the actual analytical result.
## \int_1^4{(1+1/x)^0.5}
#
## Numerically integrate the following using Midpoint, Trapezoidal and Simpson techniques with maximum error of 0.001.
## \int_0^1{x(1+x)^0.5}
#
## Use Monte Carlo to estimate the value of π from the following integral
## \int_0^1{4/1+x^2}
## Use system built random number generator and sample N starting from 10 and keep increasing in multiple of 10. Go as far as possible within a reasonable time. Plot π vs. N.
#
## A beam 2 meter long has linear mass density λ(x) = x^2 , where x is measured from one of the ends. Find the center of mass of the beam numerically.
